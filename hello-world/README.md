# HelloWorld

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## What will we learn in this tutorial
1) The basic structure of a component
2) Public variable created in component and used in markup
3) Test cases to detect:
    - Component creation 
    - Rendering of the html element with default value of title
    - Rendering of the html element with runtime updated value of title 
4) End to test to check the rendering the html element with expected text

Steps to run the app:
- Clone the folder and run <b>npm i</b> to use the app.
- run <b>ng serve</b>
- run <b>ng serve --port 9000</b> if you want to run of a specific port
- run <b>ng test</b> to unit test using karma
- run <b>ng e2e</b> for end to end testing using protractor

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
