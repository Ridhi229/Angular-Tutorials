# Component

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## What will we learn in this tutorial
1) Using multiple instances of a component
2) Passing different input values to different instances of a component
3) Test cases to detect:
    - 
4) End to test cases to check the rendering of different instances of a component with different content in it
5) constructor
6) @Input
7) ngOnit

## Steps to run the app:
- Clone the folder and run <b>npm i</b> to use the app.
- run <b>ng serve</b>
- run <b>ng serve --port 9000</b> if you want to run of a specific port
- run <b>ng test</b> to unit test using karma
- run <b>ng e2e</b> for end to end testing using protractor

## Excercise
1) Change the default number of the classes to 20
2) Write test case to detect the number of classes
3) Update the categories array and use 5 items in it 
4) Update test cases to detect the number of categories
5) Use category with no item in it and check that element is not generated in DOM.
6) Write test cases to check the method written in class

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
